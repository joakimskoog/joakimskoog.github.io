![Me think, why waste time say lot word, when few word do trick.](/images/why-waste-time-say-lot-word.jpg)

Websites today are too slow. 

Too complex.

You don't need megabytes of JavaScript and CSS to put text on a screen. Favor simplicity over complexity.

This site has 0 lines of JavaScript and 15 CSS declarations (dark mode included). Simple. Fast. Beautiful.

Less is more.
