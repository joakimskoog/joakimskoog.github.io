# Joakim Skog Lundell

**I build useful stuff with software.** I'm currently helping people run their small businesses through automation with [Bokio](https://bokio.se/). Previously, I worked on [Nelly.com](https://nelly.com/). I also build open source projects over at [Github](https://github.com/joakimskoog) and occasionally write about topics that interest me.
